This directory hold various examples of analytic profiles used for fitting Neutron Reflectometry data. By analytic profiles we mean that the model is parameterised with physically relevant parameters. For example, in a lipid membrane system one may want to parameterise a bilayer in terms of an area per molecule, so that one has a 1 to 1 correspondence of heads to tails, instead of using a independent thickness and SLD for each head/tail region.

To create such a profile one must inherit the `refnx.analysis.reflect.AnalyticReflectivityFunction` class and override the `to_slab` method. The `to_slab` method should take your model parameters and return a vector of values that can be used for a slab model calculation. For a continuously varying SLD profile, e.g. a parabolic decay, one must split the interfacial region into a series of 'micro-slabs' that when assembled approximates your desired SLD profile.
The vector of values that to_slab should return is documented in `refnx.analysis.reflect.reflectivity`:

    * coefs[0] = number of layers, N
    * coefs[1] = scale factor
    * coefs[2] = SLD of fronting (/1e-6 Angstrom**-2)
    * coefs[3] = iSLD of fronting (/1e-6 Angstrom**-2)
    * coefs[4] = SLD of backing
    * coefs[5] = iSLD of backing
    * coefs[6] = background
    * coefs[7] = roughness between backing and layer N

    * coefs[4 * (N - 1) + 8] = thickness of layer N in Angstrom (layer 1 is
    closest to fronting)
    * coefs[4 * (N - 1) + 9] = SLD of layer N (/ 1e-6 Angstrom**-2)
    * coefs[4 * (N - 1) + 10] = iSLD of layer N (/ 1e-6 Angstrom**-2)
    * coefs[4 * (N - 1) + 11] = roughness between layer N and N-1.
